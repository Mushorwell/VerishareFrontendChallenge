![Alt text](/StaticFiles/resources/Dashboard.png "Dashboard")# Page Development DocumentationTo create the dashboard, static HTML & CSS templates were developed which would be later used to convert to react components. A global CSS was file was initially created to handle all the styling for the dashboard. At a later stage it was refactored into smaller component focused files which would later be the basis for the component css modules. ![Alt text](/StaticFiles/resources/ComponentTree.png "Timeline for challenge")With the aid of a component tree design to visualize what the structure of the react project would look like, the css modules were developed and refactored to handle only styling on their corresponding components: ## Time constraintsBelow is the timeline for the development of the dashboard for this challenge.![Alt text](/StaticFiles/resources/Timeline.png "Timeline for challenge")The only external module used in this project is the 'react-icons' package for easy access to a variety of icons to populate the dashboard as in the UI design. ## ResponsivenessThe project currently is designed specifically for 1366x768 displays with some minor responsiveness for larger screens, however, the next stage is to make it responsive for mobile devices especially tablets and phones. A design has already been drafted and may later on be fully implemented for this dashboard project.# Getting Started with Create React AppThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).## Available ScriptsIn the project directory, you can run:### `yarn start`Runs the app in the development mode.\Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.The page will reload if you make edits.\You will also see any lint errors in the console.### `yarn test`Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.### `yarn build`Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\Your app is ready to be deployed!See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.### `yarn eject`**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.## Learn MoreYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).### Code SplittingThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting)### Analyzing the Bundle SizeThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size)### Making a Progressive Web AppThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app)### Advanced ConfigurationThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration)### DeploymentThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)### `yarn build` fails to minifyThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)
